# Devlog 1

## Overview
Continuing research and starting boiler plate.

## Goals
- Finish deciding on what I'm using for the project.

## Accomplishments
- ### Decisions:
    - Container Management : Terraform
        - A bit overkill for what I'm making but would love to learn more about it. So that will be the focus of learning here.
    - Backend: dart_frog
        - Used dart in the past, really enjoy it. Has good libraries for encryption/decryption. Concerned about the websocket support as I assume it will be needed.
    - Frontend: vite/react, tailwind
        - familiar choice for frontend as it's not really a frontend focused project.

- Started doing boilerplate / getting things setup + learning about the tech I chose.

## Challenges
- As mentioned, I am concerned about the websocket support for dart_frog. They support ws fine, but I don't see any documentation on their website / online forums for secure socket.

## Lessons Learned
- still not much room for mistakes haha... 
- we will see later in the project if these decisions will become lessons learned :)

## Next Steps
- Will need to do brief and then more detailed diagrams on how the architecture will look like before I get started on the work.

## Conclusion
 Some worries on plausibility, but will continue looking step by step. I think once I draw out some of the architecture things will be easier to understand.
