# Devlog 3

## Overview
Overall Architecture and starting backend work

## Goals
- Draw out architecure in order to start working

## Accomplishments
- Drew out my diagrams and have confidence that I can get this working.

## Challenges
- Websocket support is still weak but I have a work around for now.
    - Will need to run a aes key over all websocket sessions.

## Lessons Learned
- Choosing a framework with no wss support makes life a bit harder now that I have to worry about more key management...
- Valid concerns on whether or not the tech should always be throroughly examined.
- Due to me sticking to dart_frog I now have more dev work to do.
- Wrong Tech == More Work for the team.

## Next Steps
- Let's get started!

## Conclusion
 - Learned some lessons, but confident in my ability to learn/adapt to the constraints I now have.
